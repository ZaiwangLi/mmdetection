def bbox_overlaps(bboxes1, bboxes2, mode='iou', is_aligned=False):
    """Calculate overlap between two set of bboxes.

    If ``is_aligned`` is ``False``, then calculate the ious between each bbox
    of bboxes1 and bboxes2, otherwise the ious between each aligned pair of
    bboxes1 and bboxes2.

    Args:
        bboxes1 (Tensor): shape (m, 4) in <x1, y1, x2, y2> format.
        bboxes2 (Tensor): shape (n, 4) in <x1, y1, x2, y2> format.
            If is_aligned is ``True``, then m and n must be equal.
        mode (str): "iou" (intersection over union) or iof (intersection over
            foreground).

    Returns:
        ious(Tensor): shape (m, n) if is_aligned == False else shape (m, 1)

    Example:
        >>> bboxes1 = torch.FloatTensor([
        >>>     [0, 0, 10, 10],
        >>>     [10, 10, 20, 20],
