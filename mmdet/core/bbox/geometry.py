# broadcast rule and score matrix.
# if we have box lists bboxes=[b1, b2, b3, b4], gt = [b5, b6, b7, b8]
# then the overlap score matrix:
#        b1   b2    b3   b4
#    b5  0.1  0.5   0.4  0.6
#    b6  0.1  0.9   0.3  0.3

#    b8  0.2  0.2.5 0.2  0.1
# How to assign? 

# score matrix is a commonly used method for match algortihms,
# eg: tracking will have a score matrix to decide whether objects 
# from 2 different frames are the same objects

    If ``is_aligned`` is ``False``, then calculate the ious between each bbox
    of bboxes1 and bboxes2, otherwise the ious between each aligned pair of
    bboxes1 and bboxes2.

    Args:
        bboxes1 (Tensor): shape (m, 4) in <x1, y1, x2, y2> format.
        bboxes2 (Tensor): shape (n, 4) in <x1, y1, x2, y2> format.
            If is_aligned is ``True``, then m and n must be equal.
        mode (str): "iou" (intersection over union) or iof (intersection over
            foreground).

    Returns:
        ious(Tensor): shape (m, n) if is_aligned == False else shape (m, 1)

        >>> bboxes1 = torch.FloatTensor([
